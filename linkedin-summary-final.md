## THE SUMMARY (Copy from below)

```
I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night.

Full-stack engineer shipping production code across .NET, Node.js, and Python—with a genuine obsession for browser automation and LLMs.

At work, I've built multi-tenant B2B platforms, POS systems, ticketing engines, and accreditation portals handling real-world transactions at scale. Complex integrations, hardware devices, real-time updates—the full enterprise stack.

On my own time, I build what excites me most: AI-powered automation. My side project is a browser automation platform combining Playwright, LangChain, and multi-provider LLM support. It orchestrates workflows across anti-detect browsers with humanization for bot evasion—complete with a desktop app and job queue system.

I've shipped systems with 300+ controllers, integrated thermal printers and card encoders, designed auth flows, and written database queries that actually perform. I care about code that works in production—tested, maintainable, and built to handle edge cases.

Based in Salzburg, Austria.

## WHY THIS VERSION

### What Changed
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Long tech lists (C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Node.js, Express...) | Clean prose, no bullet lists |
| "Looking for roles where..." | Removed—confident positioning, not job-seeking |
| No website link | Ends with website invitation |
| Generic call to action | "More about my stack and projects" |

### The Hook + Headline Combo
**Headline:** `Enterprise by Day, AI Automation by Night | Full-Stack Engineer`
**First line:** `I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night.`

This reinforces your positioning across both touchpoints. Works for:
- Enterprise companies (see: B2B, POS, ticketing, 300+ controllers)
- Startups (see: AI automation, LLMs, modern stack)
- AI/Automation roles (see: personal project passion)

### No Desperate Job-Seeking Language
Instead of "open to opportunities" or "looking for roles," it simply states what you do and invites people to learn more. This is a stronger position—you're not asking, you're presenting.

### Website as the Tech Deep-Dive
Rather than listing 40 technologies in the summary (which looks cluttered and triggers LinkedIn's spam detection), the website link invites recruiters who want specifics to explore further. This:
- Keeps the summary clean and readable
- Drives traffic to your portfolio
- Lets your website do the detailed selling
- Shows you have a professional online presence
