# LinkedIn Summary - FINAL v3
## Three Options — Pick Your Favorite

---

## HEADLINE (same for all)

```
Enterprise by Day, AI Automation by Night | Full-Stack Engineer
```

---

## OPTION A: The Rhythm

Short. Punchy. Every line earns its place.

```
I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night.
arshiahemati.com

At work: B2B platforms. POS systems. Ticketing engines. 300+ controllers. Hardware integrations. Code that handles real money.

After hours: AI browser automation from scratch. LLM orchestration. Anti-detect browsers. Humanization for bot evasion. Full production stack.

Side projects should ship too.

.NET · Node.js · Python

Salzburg, Austria.
```

**Why it works:**
- ~630 characters (extremely tight)
- Website in first 100 chars
- Period-separated items create rhythm
- "Side projects should ship too" is a philosophy statement, not a list item
- The dots (·) in the ecosystem line add visual elegance

---

## OPTION B: The Contrast

Plays up the duality as the central theme.

```
I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night.
arshiahemati.com

Two tracks. Same standards.

Work gave me scale—B2B platforms, POS systems, ticketing engines. 300+ controllers shipped. Hardware that talks to software. Code that processes real transactions.

Curiosity gave me edge—AI browser automation built from scratch. LLM orchestration, anti-detect browsers, humanization for bot evasion. Desktop app, job queues, full architecture.

.NET · Node.js · Python

Salzburg, Austria.
```

**Why it works:**
- ~720 characters
- "Two tracks. Same standards." is memorable
- "Work gave me scale... Curiosity gave me edge..." tells a growth story
- The parallel structure reinforces the duality

---

## OPTION C: The Confident

Minimal. No explanation needed.

```
I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night.
arshiahemati.com

300+ controllers shipped. B2B platforms. POS systems. Ticketing engines. Hardware integrations. Real transactions at scale.

An AI browser automation platform—built from scratch. LLM orchestration. Anti-detect browsers. Humanization for bot evasion. Because side projects should ship too.

.NET · Node.js · Python

Salzburg, Austria.
```

**Why it works:**
- ~580 characters (tightest version)
- Leads with proof (300+ controllers) not claims
- No "At work" / "After hours" labels — just facts
- The reader figures out the duality themselves

---

## FIRST 250 CHARACTERS (All Options)

All three options show this before "see more":

```
I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night.
arshiahemati.com
```

**~90 characters** — Hook + website both visible. Always.

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**Option A** if you want clean and scannable.
**Option B** if you want the duality to be the story.
**Option C** if you want maximum confidence with minimum words.

All three:
- ✓ Website immediately after hook
- ✓ Ecosystems only (.NET · Node.js · Python)
- ✓ No "looking for roles" language
- ✓ No technology spam
- ✓ "Side projects should ship too" personality
- ✓ Under 750 characters

---

## WHAT I REMOVED (AND WHY)

| Removed | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "Full-stack engineer shipping production code across..." | Filler. The hook already says what you do. |
| "complex integrations handling real transactions at scale" | "Code that handles real money" is tighter. |
| "payment processing, the full enterprise stack" | Redundant with other enterprise items. |
| "full production architecture because side projects should ship too" | Split into two thoughts for impact. |
| Long ecosystem descriptions | Website handles this. |
| Any form of "open to opportunities" | Confident people don't ask. |

---

## THE PHILOSOPHY LINE

> "Side projects should ship too."

This single line does more work than a paragraph:
- Shows you have standards
- Shows you finish things
- Shows you're not just a hobbyist
- Shows personality
- Implies your side project IS production-grade
