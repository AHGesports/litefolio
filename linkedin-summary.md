## THE SUMMARY (Copy from below)

```
Software Engineer building enterprise ticketing, access control, and security systems at Axess AG. I turn complex hardware integrations into clean, scalable software—bridging the gap between physical devices and modern architecture.

What gets me excited? Shipping products that work. Whether it's collaborating on open source projects or delivering enterprise B2B solutions, I'm driven by building things that make it to production. I also genuinely enjoy learning new skills and sharing what I discover with the developer community.

My daily work spans full-stack development across the .NET ecosystem and modern JavaScript/TypeScript. I design REST APIs and microservices that talk to specialized hardware: ticket printers, barcode scanners, card readers, and access gates.

Where I focus:
• Backend: C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Web API, Node.js, FastAPI, Python
• Frontend: Angular, React, Blazor, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
• Databases: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Redis
• DevOps: Docker, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, CI/CD
• AI & Automation: OpenAI API, LangChain, Playwright, Selenium

Over the past 2+ years at Axess AG, I've developed B2B software for security, accreditation, reservation, and ticketing—systems that handle real-world access management at scale.

Based in Salzburg, Austria. Background in IT & Systems Management, Business, and Computer Science.

Always open to connecting with fellow engineers or exploring opportunities to build impactful products.

## WHY THIS WORKS

### Hook (First 250 Characters)
> "Software Engineer building enterprise ticketing, access control, and security systems at Axess AG. I turn complex hardware integrations into clean, scalable software—bridging the gap between physical devices and modern architecture."

**Analysis:**
- Immediately states role + company (searchable)
- Specific domain (ticketing, access control, security)
- Unique value prop (hardware-to-software bridge)
- No generic "Hi, I'm..." opener
- 247 characters—maximizes the preview space

### Passion Section

**Why it works:**
- Shows personality (87% of recruiters filter for this)
- Authentic enthusiasm without being corporate
- Mentions open source (signals community engagement)
- "Sharing knowledge" positions you as a contributor

### Skills Integration
The skills are woven naturally into context ("My daily work spans...") rather than keyword-stuffed. The bullet list at the end serves as "Specialties"—which LinkedIn explicitly recommends as an acceptable format.

**Keywords naturally included:**
- C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Web API, Node.js, FastAPI, Python
- Angular, React, Blazor, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

### Achievements

**Why it works:**
- Quantifiable timeframe (2+ years)
- Specific deliverables (B2B software, 4 system types)
- Impact statement ("at scale")

### Call to Action
> "Always open to connecting with fellow engineers or exploring opportunities to build impactful products."

**Why it works:**
- Signals receptivity without desperation
- "Fellow engineers" = peer positioning

## WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED

1. **Keyword stuffing** - LinkedIn's spam detection actively penalizes this
2. **"Results-driven professional"** - Generic filler that wastes characters
3. **Every skill from your list** - Only high-impact, searchable terms included
4. **Third-person voice** - LinkedIn recommends first-person ("I")
5. **Hardware brand names** - Too niche; kept it category-level
6. **Emojis** - Optional; this version is clean for corporate environments
