## THE SUMMARY

```
I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night.
See my full stack and projects: arshiahemati.com

Full-stack engineer shipping production code across .NET, Node.js, and Python ecosystems.

At work, I've built multi-tenant B2B platforms, POS systems, ticketing engines, and accreditation portals—complex integrations handling real transactions at scale. Hardware devices, real-time communication, payment processing, the full enterprise stack.

On my own time, I build what excites me: AI-powered browser automation. My side project orchestrates workflows with multi-provider LLM support, anti-detect browser integration, and humanization for bot evasion. Desktop app, job queues, full production architecture.

I've shipped systems with 300+ controllers, integrated printers and card encoders, designed auth flows, and written database queries that perform. Production code—tested, maintainable, built for edge cases.

Salzburg, Austria.

## WHY THIS STRUCTURE WORKS

### First 250 Characters (Before "See More")

```

```

**~135 characters** — Both the hook AND your website are visible to everyone, even those who never click "see more."

### What Recruiters See Without Expanding:
1. Your unique positioning (enterprise + AI)
2. Your website (drives traffic)
3. Enough intrigue to click "see more"

### Ecosystems, Not Tech Lists

| Before (Cluttered) | After (Clean) |
|--------------------|---------------|
| C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Node.js, Express, Fastify, Python, FastAPI... | .NET, Node.js, and Python ecosystems |
| Angular, React, Blazor, Tailwind, RxJS, PrimeNG... | (Let website explain) |
| OpenAI API, Anthropic API, LangChain, Playwright, Puppeteer... | Multi-provider LLM support, browser automation |

Your website handles the specifics. The summary handles positioning.
