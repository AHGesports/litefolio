## THE SUMMARY (Copy from below)

```
I build enterprise systems by day and AI automation tools by night. Full-stack engineer shipping production code in .NET, Node.js, and Python—with a deep obsession for browser automation and LLMs.

At work, I've built multi-tenant B2B platforms, POS systems, ticketing engines, and accreditation portals handling real-world transactions at scale. Oracle databases, complex payment integrations, hardware devices, SignalR real-time updates—the full enterprise stack.

On my own time, I build what excites me most: AI-powered automation. My side project is a browser automation platform combining Playwright, LangChain, and multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). It orchestrates workflows across anti-detect browsers with humanization for bot evasion—3-tier architecture, job queues, desktop app, the works.

What I work with daily:

Backend — C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Node.js, Express, FastAPI, Python
Frontend — Angular, React, Blazor, Tailwind CSS, RxJS
Databases — Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Redis
AI & Automation — OpenAI API, Anthropic API, LangChain, Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium
DevOps — Docker, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, CI/CD

I've shipped systems with 300+ controllers, integrated thermal printers and card encoders, designed JWT auth flows, and written PL/SQL that actually performs. I care about code that works in production—tested, maintainable, and built to handle edge cases.

Based in Salzburg, Austria. Looking for roles where I can bring enterprise rigor and AI curiosity to the same table.
