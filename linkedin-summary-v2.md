## THE SUMMARY (Copy from below)

```
Full-Stack Software Engineer fluent in three ecosystems: .NET, Node.js, and Python. I build everything from enterprise backend systems to AI-powered automation tools—and I genuinely enjoy bridging the gap between complex requirements and clean, maintainable code.

What I bring to the table:

Backend & APIs
I design and ship production systems using C#/.NET Core, Node.js (Express, Fastify), and Python (FastAPI). Comfortable with REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and SOAP. I've built multi-tenant B2B platforms, real-time systems with Redis and BullMQ, and APIs that integrate with specialized hardware.

Frontend
Angular is my primary framework, but I work across React, Blazor, Astro, and vanilla JS when the project calls for it. RxJS, Tailwind CSS, and component libraries like PrimeNG are part of my daily toolkit.

Databases
Deep experience with Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MySQL. I write optimized PL/SQL, design schemas, and work with ORMs like Entity Framework Core, Dapper, and NHibernate.

AI & Automation
This is where I get excited. I build with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini APIs. I've implemented LangChain pipelines, prompt engineering workflows, and browser automation at scale using Playwright, Puppeteer, and Selenium—including stealth techniques for anti-bot environments.

DevOps & Quality
Docker, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines. TDD advocate with experience in Jest, xUnit, and pytest.

I ship code that works in production—scalable, tested, and built to last. Currently based in Salzburg, Austria, and open to opportunities where I can contribute across the full stack.

## WHY THIS VERSION WORKS BETTER

### 1. The Hook Is Ecosystem-Focused, Not Company-Focused
> "Full-Stack Software Engineer fluent in three ecosystems: .NET, Node.js, and Python."

This immediately tells any recruiter: "This person isn't locked into one stack." That's valuable for companies using mixed technologies or planning migrations.

### 2. Structured "What I Bring" Format
Instead of telling a story about one job, this uses clear sections that let recruiters scan for what they need:
- Backend & APIs
- Frontend
- Databases
- AI & Automation
- DevOps & Quality

This format works because:
- Recruiters spend 6 seconds on average scanning profiles
- Section headers act as "anchor points"
- Each section proves depth, not just buzzwords

### 3. AI & Automation Gets Its Own Section
This is your differentiator. Most .NET developers don't know LangChain. Most Python devs haven't done enterprise .NET. You do both—and you've done browser automation at scale including stealth/anti-bot work. That's rare and valuable in 2024-2025.

### 4. No Company Names = Universal Appeal
The previous version said "Axess AG" which:
- Limits appeal to similar industries
- Makes it about what you did there, not what you CAN do

This version says "multi-tenant B2B platforms" and "APIs that integrate with specialized hardware"—same experience, broader framing.

### 5. Keywords Are Natural, Not Stuffed
Technologies mentioned naturally in context:
- C#, .NET Core, Node.js, Express, Fastify, Python, FastAPI
- REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP
- Angular, React, Blazor, Astro, RxJS, Tailwind CSS, PrimeNG
- Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, Entity Framework Core, Dapper, NHibernate
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, LangChain, Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium
- Docker, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, TDD, Jest, xUnit, pytest

### 6. Personality Without Fluff
> "This is where I get excited."
> "I ship code that works in production—scalable, tested, and built to last."

Shows enthusiasm and standards without corporate buzzwords like "passionate self-starter" or "results-driven professional."
