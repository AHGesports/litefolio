  INTEGRATION FLOW

  Workflow Execution

  User clicks "Execute" in ExpressUI
    → ExecutionRequest created
    → POST /api/workflows/execute-workflow
    → ExpressAPI WorkflowExecutionService
    → HTTP POST to Python /execute-workflow
    → Playwright + Browser-Use initialization
    → Returns ExecutionResponse
    → ExpressUI polls /workflow-state every 5s
    → WorkflowPollingResponse updates in real-time

  Profile Creation

  User creates AI-powered profile
    → ProfileRequest with AI provider
    → POST /api/profiles/create-ai-profile
    → ExpressAPI calls Python /create-profile
    → LLM generates realistic persona (name, email, location)
    → Anti-detect provider integration
    → ProfileResponse returned

  Scheduling

  User sets workflow schedule
    → ScheduleRequest stored in LowDB
    → BullMQ job scheduled
    → At trigger time, Python API polled
    → Workflow auto-executed
    → Result persisted and notified

  ---
  TESTING

  Test Coverage

  - Unit Tests: Service functionality, model validation      
  - Integration Tests: API endpoint + service interaction    
  - E2E Tests: Complete workflow execution (UI → API → Python)

  NOTABLE CHARACTERISTICS

  Strengths

  ✅ Type-Safe Across Services - Strict typing (JavaScript, Python with Pyright)
  ✅ Comprehensive Testing - 7,862 Python files include extensive test infrastructure
  ✅ Production-Ready - Tauri desktop with cryptographic updates, process management
  ✅ Multi-AI Support - Seamless integration with OpenAI, Claude, Google, Groq, Ollama
  ✅ Anti-Bot Evasion - Sophisticated humanization + anti-detect provider integration
  ✅ Excellent Documentation - 47+ guides covering architecture, debugging, features
  ✅ Service Independence - Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
  ✅ Strict Architecture - Clear separation of concerns, SOLID principles

  Technical Considerations

  ⚠️ Scalability Limits - LowDB (JSON files) not suitable forr massive scale
  ⚠️ Enum Synchronization - StatusEnums must be manually keptt in sync across 3 services
  ⚠️ Single Redis - No clustering/high availability (suitablee for current scale)
  ⚠️ Python Startup - Desktop app startup overhead due to PyIInstaller
  ⚠️ Browser Flakiness - Inherent unreliability of browser auutomation (network, crashes)
  ⚠️ Complexity - 82,646 total files, multiple languages, steeep learning curve

  ---
